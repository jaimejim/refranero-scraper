This program craws the fantastic Spanish-language Refranero Multing√ºe maintained by the Centro Virtual Cervantes: http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/refranero/Default.aspx

It crawls all pages and outputs a list of Spanish idioms with their Spanish definition, frequency of use, and English idiomatic equivalent, if possible.

Because the center reserves all rights (Reservados todos los derechos), you likely can only use the data for non-commercial consumption.
