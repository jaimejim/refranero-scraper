This program crawls the fantastic Spanish-language Refranero MultingÃ¼e maintained by the Centro Virtual Cervantes: http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/refranero/Default.aspx. Because the center reserves all rights (Reservados todos los derechos), you likely can only use the data for non-commercial consumption.

It outputs a list of Spanish idioms with their Spanish definition. It only prints idioms that are heavily used today ("Muy usado").

Usage:

1. Get link slugs for all idioms:

    refranero-scraper -print-slugs > slugs.txt

2. Parse all links and print out the most common ones with definitions (may take a while, about ~2000 pages to parse):

    < slugs.txt | refranero-scraper -read-slugs > idioms_and_definitions.txt
